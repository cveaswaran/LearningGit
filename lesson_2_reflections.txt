Reflections - Lesson 2

1.
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When you initialize a repository, git creates a directory called .git/ to hold metadata information about the repository. Because git repositories are collections of files, you would want a way to indicate which files are in the repo, and keep track of changes to the repo and its files. This is the purpose of the metadata directory. 

2.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

A staging area conceptually  describes files that are ready to be committed to the repo, but haven't yet been committed. Working directory is where you modify your files. After making modifications, you can stage a file using "git add filename" command to indicate that the file is to be placed in the staging area.

The separation between working directory and a staging area allows us to distinguish a work in progress from a completed logical unit that is ready to be committed.
